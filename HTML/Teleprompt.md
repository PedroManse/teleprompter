Simple code to fill a gap I found
Looking online for a free teleprompter to help me rehearse to a presentation I was faced with a ton of option that let you regulate the scroll speed
But none that let you define the total time of presentation
The closest I found was https://www.teleprompter-online.com/
But during my tests I realised that no matter how much I increased the speed after a certain point it capped
That led me to timing 12 minutes of presentation when the site's timer said it would be over in 5 minutes
Thankfully I caught that before the presentation
But when the tool available won't cut it, we make it
So I did a simple html, (integrated with js and css, but still basic) that let's you define, in seconds, how long to scroll for
Hopefully it helps someone out there as well!
